        These augments are recommended at stage 2-1 as it allows you to reach
        level 8 by stage 4-2 on schedule with enough gold (about 40) to roll for
        upgraded board These are less good later stages (besides fast 9 meta)

        These augments are recommended at stage 2-1 and 3-2 as it allows you to have early board strength and go on win streaks, also have strong mid game with more itemized units. These augments are not great at stage 4 as combat augments outscale them.
        <br /><br />
        Examples :
        <br /><br />
        Silver : Buried treasures, item grab bag
        <br /><br />
        Gold : Buried treasures, Support augments, Portable forge

        These augments are recommended at stage 3 and 4 as they provide good late game scaling once you have made it to the late game. They can be taken at stage 2 but more often than not you will lose streak early game.

        Examples :
        <br /><br />
        Silver : Vampirism
        <br /><br />
        Gold : Gift of the fallen, Jeweled lotus, Combat caster

        These augments force you into playing a specific comp, they are terrible for stage 2 but okay at stage 4 when you are certain you know what you are playing.

        <br /><br />
        Gold : Trickshot or Porcelain Augments

        This is the order of augment choice to follow to improve your games. (Obviously OP augments may change the overall theory)

        Econ > Item > Combat (Standard)
        <br /><br />
        Item > Item > Combat (EASY TOP 4 IF WIN STREAKING)
        <br /><br />
        Item > Combat > Combat (Strong early game and scaling)
        <br /><br />
        Combat > Item > Combat (Stage 3-2 winout)
